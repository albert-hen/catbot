This is the ruleset for the game boop.

**Boop Rules**

**Setup:**
- 2 players, Ages 10+, 20 min.
- Components: 8 Orange Kittens, 8 Orange Cats (in reserve), 8 Gray Kittens, 8 Gray Cats (in reserve), 6x6 grid quilted fabric game board, Back of box (bed frame).
- Place the box bottom, upside down, in the center of the play area. On top of it, place the quilted game board comforter to make the bed.
- Players start with 8 Kittens of their color. The 8 Cats of their color begin “out of play” to the far side of the board.
- The player who most recently pet a cat goes first, or choose a first player at random.

**Objective:**
- Place one of your Kittens onto the bed in any open space available.
- Graduate your Kittens into Cats by lining up three of your pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- Line up 3 of your Cats in a row to win the game.

**Gameplay:**
- When a piece is added to the board, it “boops” all of the pieces adjacent to it, pushing them one space away, including diagonally.
- A piece can be booped off the bed, returning it to the owner’s pool of pieces.
- A booped piece does not cause a chain reaction when it moves into a new space.
- When any two pieces are already in a line, another piece played into that line cannot push those pieces. However, they can still be booped from other directions.
- Setting up a line of two and defending against it is a key strategy.

**Graduating Kittens into Cats:**
- After booping, check if you have 3 Kittens in a row. If so, all three are graduated into Cats.
- Remove the Kittens from the board and replace them with adult Cats from the reserve into your pool of pieces.
- If all 8 of your pieces are on the bed, you may graduate one Kitten by removing it from the game and placing a Cat into your pool. Should it be strategically important, you could place a Cat back into your pool, instead of graduating a Kitten.
- In the rare case of lining up more than three in a row or multiple connected 3's, choose which group of 3 to graduate.

**Cats:**
- Once you have Cats in your pool, you may choose to play either a Cat or a Kitten.
- Cats cannot be booped by Kittens but can boop other Cats and Kittens.
- When lining up 3 pieces with a combination of Cats and Kittens, remove all three pieces from the board and graduate any Kittens.

**Winning:**
- Line up three of your Cats in a row to win, or have all 8 of your Cats on the bed at the end of a turn.
- Only check for a win after all booped pieces complete their movement.

**Notes for Clever Cats:**
- The center four squares are more powerful as they are furthest from the edge.
- Pushing your own Kittens/Cats off the bed might be strategic.
- Setting up an L-shaped pattern and booping a piece into the center can be a sneaky way to create a line.
- Be mindful of placing all your Cats on the bed, especially if your opponent has none.

**Adjusting for Younger Players:**
- Eliminate the concept of graduating pieces. The first player to line up three Kittens wins the game.
